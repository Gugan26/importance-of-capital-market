        <h2>Link between savers and investors</h2>
        <h4>Capital market plays an important role in linking savers and investors. 
            It helps savers invest their money in a useful and productive way, such as by supporting developing companies.

            Companies that need funds for their growth and expansion can raise money through the capital market. 
            These funds come from the savers who are willing to invest. 
            The companies then use the money to develop their industry. 
            When the companies become profitable, the savers (investors) receive returns such as dividends or interest.
