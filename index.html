        <h2>Link between savers and investors</h2>
        <h4>Capital market plays an important role in linking savers and investors. 
            It helps savers invest their money in a useful and productive way, such as by supporting developing companies.

            Companies that need funds for their growth and expansion can raise money through the capital market. 
            These funds come from the savers who are willing to invest. 
            The companies then use the money to develop their industry. 
            When the companies become profitable, the savers (investors) receive returns such as dividends or interest.

        <h3>Savers → Capital Market → Developing Companies → Growth → Returns to Savers</h3>

        <h2>Encouragement to saving: </h2>
        <h4>With the development of the capital market, banking and non-banking institutions provide various facilities that 
            encourage people to save more.
            In less-developed countries, due to the lack of a strong capital market, there is very little saving.
            Even those who save often invest in unproductive areas like land, gold, and luxury items.
            Capital markets help channel these savings into productive investments, which benefits both individuals and the economy.
        </h4>
        <h2>Encouragement to Investment: </h2>
        <h4>The capital market plays a key role in encouraging investment. 
            It motivates savers to invest their money in productive areas like businesses and the government.
            Instead of keeping money idle, savers are encouraged to invest in financial assets such as shares, bonds, and securities. 
            These give returns like interest, dividends, or capital gains, which attracts more investors.
            The capital market also ensures safety and transparency through proper rules and regulations (like SEBI), which builds trust among investors.
            Both banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFCs) help channel savings into investments. 
            As these institutions develop, capital becomes more mobile, interest rates reduce, and investment increases.
